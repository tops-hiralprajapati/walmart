| [**acknowledgeOrders()**](#acknowledgeOrders) | **POST** /v3/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/acknowledge | Acknowledge Orders |
| [**cancelOrderLines()**](#cancelOrderLines) | **POST** /v3/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/cancel | Cancel order lines |
| [**getAllOrders()**](#getAllOrders) | **GET** /v3/orders | All orders |

## `acknowledgeOrders()`

```php
acknowledgeOrders($purchaseOrderId, $shipNode): \Walmart\Models\Supplier\US\DSVOrders\GetOrderResponseRecord
```
Acknowledge Orders

Allows a DSV to acknowledge an order, including all order lines, preferably within four hours of receipt of the order.  The response to a successful call contains the acknowledged order. As a good practice, acknowledge your orders to avoid underselling.  Only those orders that are in a Created state should be acknowledged. Orders that are in an Acknowledged state can be re-acknowledged. This is desirable, for example, when resolving an error response from a previous API call. Orders with line items that are shipped or cancelled should not be re-acknowledged.

### Example

```php
<?php
use Walmart\Configuration;
use Walmart\Enums\Country;
use Walmart\Walmart;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$config = new Walmart\Configuration([
    'clientId' => 'CLIENT_ID',          // May not be necessary for all endpoints, particularly outside the US
    'clientSecret' => 'CLIENT_SECRET',  // Ditto above
    'country' => Country::US,           // Default Country::US if not set
    'privateKey' => 'PRIVATE_KEY',
    'consumerId' => 'CONSUMER_ID',
]);

$api = Walmart::supplier($config)->dSVOrders();

$purchaseOrderId = 'purchaseOrderId_example'; // string | A unique ID associated with the purchase order. Used for querying an order.
$shipNode = 'shipNode_example'; // string | The Distribution Facility “Distributor ID” which uniquely identifies each facility and is autogenerated during DSV account creation. Every time you add/update a facility in the Supplier Center, a new ID is generated

try {
    $result = $api->acknowledgeOrders($purchaseOrderId, $shipNode);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Exception when calling DSVOrdersApi->acknowledgeOrders: {$e->getMessage()}\n";
}
```

### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **purchaseOrderId** | **string**| A unique ID associated with the purchase order. Used for querying an order. | |
| **shipNode** | **string**| The Distribution Facility “Distributor ID” which uniquely identifies each facility and is autogenerated during DSV account creation. Every time you add/update a facility in the Supplier Center, a new ID is generated | |


### Return type

### Authorization

This endpoint requires the following authorization methods:

* `partner`: Header authentication with your Walmart partner ID, which is passed in the WM_PARTNER.ID header. Required by Supplier API endpoints. When using endpoints that require partner ID authentication, you must pass the `partnerId` option to the `Configuration` constructor.
* `signature`: Request signature authentication. Request signatures are generated using a combination of request info, a timestamp, and your Walmart consumer ID and private key. The signature is passed in the WM_SEC.AUTH_SIGNATURE header. This is always used in tandem with consumer ID authentication (above). When using endpoints that require signature authentication, you must pass the `privateKey` and `consumerId` options to the `Configuration` constructor.
* `consumerId`: Header authentication with your Walmart consumer ID, which is passed in the WM_CONSUMER.ID header. This is always used in tandem with signature authentication (below). When using endpoints that require consumer ID authentication, you must pass the `consumerId` option to the `Configuration` constructor.
* `accessToken`: Header authentication with a Walmart access token, which is automatically generated using your Client ID and Client Secret. The token is valid for 15 minutes, and will be passed in the WM_SEC.ACCESS_TOKEN header

See the [Authorization](../../../../README.md#authorization) section of the README for more information.

## `cancelOrderLines()`

```php
cancelOrderLines($purchaseOrderId, $shipNode, $orderCancellation): \Walmart\Models\Supplier\US\DSVOrders\GetOrderResponseRecord
```
Cancel order lines

Cancels one or more order lines before an order has been fulfilled. A purchaseOrderId must be included to cancel an order line. After cancelling an order, the inventory for the cancelled order should be updated.  The response to a successful call contains the order with the cancelled line item.  Cancellation Reasons supported: SUPPLIER_CANCEL_CUSTOMER_REQUEST SUPPLIER_CANCEL_BACKORDER SUPPLIER_CANCEL_DISCONTINUE SUPPLIER_CANCEL_UNRECOGNIZED

### Example

```php
<?php
use Walmart\Configuration;
use Walmart\Enums\Country;

    'country' => Country::US,           // Default Country::US if not set
    'privateKey' => 'PRIVATE_KEY',
    'consumerId' => 'CONSUMER_ID',
]);

$api = Walmart::supplier($config)->dSVOrders();

$purchaseOrderId = 'purchaseOrderId_example'; // string | A unique ID associated with the purchase order. Used for querying.
$shipNode = 'shipNode_example'; // string | The Distribution Facility “Distributor ID” which uniquely identifies each facility and is autogenerated during DSV account creation. Every time you add/update a facility in the Supplier Center, a new ID is generated
$orderCancellation = {"orderCancellation":{"orderLines":{"orderLine":[{"lineNumber":"1","orderLineStatuses":{"orderLineStatus":[{"status":"Cancelled","cancellationReason":"SUPPLIER_CANCEL_UNRECOGNIZED","statusQuantity":{"unitOfMeasurement":"EACH","amount":"1"}}]}}]}}}; // \Walmart\Models\Supplier\US\DSVOrders\OrderCancellation | File fields

try {
    $result = $api->cancelOrderLines($purchaseOrderId, $shipNode, $orderCancellation);

The signature is passed in the WM_SEC.AUTH_SIGNATURE header. This is always used in tandem with consumer ID authentication (above). When using endpoints that require signature authentication, you must pass the `privateKey` and `consumerId` options to the `Configuration` constructor.
* `consumerId`: Header authentication with your Walmart consumer ID, which is passed in the WM_CONSUMER.ID header. This is always used in tandem with signature authentication (below). When using endpoints that require consumer ID authentication, you must pass the `consumerId` option to the `Configuration` constructor.
* `accessToken`: Header authentication with a Walmart access token, which is automatically generated using your Client ID and Client Secret. The token is valid for 15 minutes, and will be passed in the WM_SEC.ACCESS_TOKEN header

See the [Authorization](../../../../README.md#authorization) section of the README for more information.

## `shipOrderLines()`

```php
shipOrderLines($purchaseOrderId, $shipNode, $orderCancellation): \Walmart\Models\Supplier\US\DSVOrders\GetOrderResponseRecord
```
Ship order lines

Allows consumers to ship one or more Purchase Order lines. For Site to Store (S2S) orders, Package ASN and Pallet ASN need to be included in the request payload.  Changing the status of order lines to \"Shipped\" triggers the charge to the customer. In order to avoid underselling, orders must be acknowledged before sending a shipping update. Once an order line is marked as shipped, it cannot be updated.  **Note: shipDateTime must be in UTC. **  The response to a successful call contains the order with the shipped line item.

### Example

```php
<?php
use Walmart\Configuration;
use Walmart\Enums\Country;
use Walmart\Walmart;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$config = new Walmart\Configuration([
    'clientId' => 'CLIENT_ID',          // May not be necessary for all endpoints, particularly outside the US
    'clientSecret' => 'CLIENT_SECRET',  // Ditto above
    'country' => Country::US,           // Default Country::US if not set
    'privateKey' => 'PRIVATE_KEY',
    'consumerId' => 'CONSUMER_ID',
]);

$api = Walmart::supplier($config)->dSVOrders();

$purchaseOrderId = 'purchaseOrderId_example'; // string | A unique ID associated with the purchase order, used for querying
$shipNode = 'shipNode_example'; // string | The Distribution Facility “Distributor ID” which uniquely identifies each facility and is autogenerated during DSV account creation. Every time you add/update a facility in the Supplier Center, a new ID is generated
$orderCancellation = {"orderShipment":{"orderLines":{"orderLine":[{"lineNumber":"3","orderLineStatuses":{"orderLineStatus":[{"status":"Shipped","asn":{"packageASN":"1061414119283746","palletASN":"10614141192837465"},"statusQuantity":{"unitOfMeasurement":"EACH","amount":"1"},"trackingInfo":{"shipDateTime":1488480443000,"carrierName":{"otherCarrier":null,"carrier":"UPS"},"methodCode":"Express","trackingNumber":"12345","trackingURL":"www.ups.com"}}]}}]}}}; // \Walmart\Models\Supplier\US\DSVOrders\OrderCancellation | File fields

try {
    $result = $api->shipOrderLines($purchaseOrderId, $shipNode, $orderCancellation);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Exception when calling DSVOrdersApi->shipOrderLines: {$e->getMessage()}\n";
}
```

### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **purchaseOrderId** | **string**| A unique ID associated with the purchase order, used for querying | |
